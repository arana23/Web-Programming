                <h2>Biography about Aparajita</h2>
                <p> Hello World! My name is Aparajita Rana and I am a 3/4 Computer Science major here at Stevens.
                    I started coding when I was 14 years old, as a freshman in High School. That being said, in high school we only worked in Scratch and Java.
                    That is why, to this day, I always test and consider Java my best language. Python is a close second and after this class, I have began to like JS more as well.
                    I interned at Bank of America last year as a Technology Analyst and this summer I will be working at JP Morgan Chase as a Software Engineer.
                </p>
                <p> I have one older sister who actually also went to Stevens. She was a Engineering Management major with a Financial Analytics Master's Degree.
                    (She graduated with her undergraduate and master's degree in 4 years... couldn't be me) She was living in Jersey City but moved back home because of COVID-19.
                    She is very smart it's unreal. She currently works at American Express. 
                    I am luckily in Hoboken and actually just got my first dose of the vaccine on Friday. I am feeling pretty good so far but fingers crossed!
                </p>
